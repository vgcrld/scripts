    CPU (Logical) Utilization
  </h2>
  <div class='help-content-container'>
    <div class='help-content'>
      <div class='main'>
        This chart shows the <b>Logical CPU Utilization</b> (%Busy) for a host.
      </div>
      <div class='definitions'>
        <ul>
          <li><b># of Logical CPUs</b> represents the number of logical processors (LPs) presented/assigned to this host.  If Hyper-Threading (HT) is enabled, the number of LPs will be greater than the <b># of Virtual CPUs</b> in the <b>CPU Consumed</b> chart.  Hyper-threading, also known as Simultaneous Multi-Threading (SMT), is the ability of a single physical processor (core) to concurrently process multiple program threads from the operating system.  Two or more program threads can run on one physical processor (core) at the same time.  Hyper-threading is a good choice when overall throughput is more important than the throughput of an individual thread.  For example, Web and database servers are good candidates.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li><b>User</b> represents the percentage of time the host's logical CPUs spend in user mode.  Programs running in USER mode don't have access to the kernel or its data segments, except indirectly through system calls.  A program in this mode can only affect its own execution environment and runs in the processor-unprivileged state.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li><b>System/Privileged</b> represents the percentage of time the host's logical CPUs spend in system/privileged mode.  Programs that run in this mode include interrupt handlers, base kernel and kernel extensions (including device drivers).  Programs running in system/privileged mode have read/write access to global kernel address space and to the kernel data in the process private segment when running in the process context.  Context switch time, system calls, device interrupts, CIFS/NFS I/O and anything else being processed by the kernel is considered system time.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Wait/Interrupt</b> details the percentage of time the CPU was idle with pending I/O interrupts (typically disk I/O, including local and CIFS/NFS-mounted file systems).</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div class='notes'>
        Traditionally REAL CPU Consumed is the sum of user + system, but in virtual environments, often wait and idle processing should be considered as they are included in the Physical CPU consumed by a virtual host.  Because some operating systems do not poll CPU statistics for each core at the same time interval, there may be instances when CPU utilization will exceed 100%.

    Run Queue/Processor Queue Length
  </h2>
  <div class='help-content-container'>
    <div class='help-content'>
      <div class='main'>
        <p>
          This chart displays the <b>Run Queue</b> of the host (known as <b>Processor Queue Length</b> for Windows).  The run queue indicates the number of active running processes on the host that are presently consuming resources.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, if the process 'httpd' is running, but not being accessed, it will not be 'counted' in the run queue.  In this case, the httpd process is sleeping, waiting for the next interrupt to begin processing.  When an interrupt occurs, the httpd process will be moved to the run queue, and the run queue number will be increased by 1.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are several opinions and rule-of-thumbs on the run queue number, but it depends on your particular workload and service level objectives.  If 'response time' is most important, you may want it no higher than 1 to 2 times the number of CPUs (virtual or real) allocated to the host.  If 'job throughput' is important, 3 to 4+ times the number of CPUs may be sufficient to keep the processors busy, especially with SMT/Hyper-Threading on.  A high run queue may be a sign of an overcommitted system, CPU intensive process(es) hogging the queue or a user/job-scheduling package or script mistakenly running too many processes at once.  Context Switch/System Calls, Processes Forks/EXECs and the CPU Utilization charts may be of help.

          <li><b># of Logical CPUs</b> is the number of logical processors (LP) defined by the OS for this LPAR.  If SMT (Hyper-Threading) is enabled, two or more LPs will be assigned to each VP/core.

          <li><b>Physical CPU Consumed</b> is the number of physical processor units consumed (Used) by this LPAR.  This is the total amount of physical CPU usage.  The "CPU Virtual/Core Utilization" chart can be referenced for a breakdown of this consumption (User, System, IOwait, Idle).</li>
          <li><b>Entitlement</b> is the number of physical processor units this LPAR is entitled to and guaranteed by the Hypervisor.  When the LPAR Physical CPU Consumption is less than the Entitlement, the LPAR (shared only) will donate excess physical CPU units to the shared pool for use by other LPARs "exceeding" their entitlement.  When the LPAR Physical CPU Consumption is greater than the Entitlement (uncapped), the LPAR will request more physical CPU from the shared pool via the Hypervisor.

        <p>Caution:</p>
        <p>If the average Physical CPU Consumption is greater than the Entitlement and this is a production LPAR, the Entitlement should be increased to the average or more to reduce overhead.  The "CPU Entitlement Utilization" chart provides a quick indicator of this by showing the percent consumed against the Entitlement.  For example, whenever the Physical CPU Consumption is over 100%, the LPAR is using more than the Entitlement setting.</p>

    <div class='help-content'>
      <div class='main'>
        <p>If there are a number of LPARs that exist on the managed system, we require a way to prioritize shared CPU, and how it is distributed to those partitions.  The <b>LPAR Weight</b> designates this value.  For example:</p>
        <table cellpadding='5' cellspacing='5'>
          <tr>
            <td>LPAR Name</td>
            <td>LPAR CPU Desired</td>
            <td>LPAR Weight</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>VIO Server 1</td>
            <td>.5</td>
            <td>255</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>DB Server 1</td>
            <td>4</td>

            <td>.2</td>
            <td>127</td>
          </tr>
        </table>
        <p>In the above example, <b>VIO server 1</b> has the highest weight (255) and therefore will always get the CPU that is required.  When this LPAR requires CPU, .5 processor will be made available to it, regardless of the CPU utilization on other LPARs.</p>
        <p>The remaining available CPU (if there is any available) is distributed to the other LPARs in order of descending weights.  In this case, 4 CPUs are available to <b>DB server 1</b>.  This CPU is pulled from the engine that is available, once higher priority LPAR CPU allocations have been satisfied.</p>
        <p>The remaining LPARs (<b>APP server 1</b> and <b>Static Content server 1</b>) will contend for the remaining CPU resources after the higher priority servers have been satisfied.  Since they are both of equal weight in terms of CPU allocation, they will contend with one another for available CPU cycles, assuming that CPU is available.  If there is no CPU available to those remaining LPARs, they will be forced to wait until CPU from the higher priority LPARs is available for use.</p>

        <p>Great care should be taken to fully understand how <b>Huge/Large Page Memory</b> works as it can cause severe memory constraints, paging and memory thrashing if used incorrectly.  For example, if the chart shows 4000 MB (4 GB) of allocated memory but 0 MB Used, then 4 GB of "Free" memory exists, though it does not show up on the free memory list, and it is NOT for use by general applications.  The system could incur system paging and poor response time because of a shortage of memory, while this 4 GB is reserved, but unavailable to unauthorized applications.</p>
        <p>You can quickly identify if the Huge/Large Page Memory is over or under allocated.  If the trend shows continual free memory (over allocation = allocated - used), consideration should be given to reducing the allocation, giving memory back for general use.</p>

        This chart shows the total active CPU units on the managed system, as well as the

        LPARs in a stacked area view.  Depending upon the physical
        architecture (i.e., Power5, Power6, Power7, etc.), the CPUs are defined
        to an LPAR in one of the following Types-Modes:
        <ul>

          <li><b>Shared-Capped</b> Share unused CPU with others; CANNOT go above Entitlement</li>

        <p>This physical server view can be used to determine if more CPUs are needed (possibly using CUoD), or which LPARs are the largest consumers of CPU resources.  This chart can be used to determine if an LPAR requires tuning, or if an adjustment to the Weight, Entitlement, Capping or number of Virtual Processors is necessary.  The Shared Usage + Dedicated Allocation and Dedicated-Capped Allocation + Donated/Shared Usage charts should be reviewed to identify "Dedicated-Capped" LPARs with low CPU usage and over-allocated CPUs which may be reclaimed and shared with others.</p>
        <p>Since an LPAR's type and mode may have changed over the time duration selected for viewing, the additional charts referenced above should be reviewed for a thorough understanding.</p>

    Host CPU (Logical) Percent Busy
  </h2>
  <div class='help-content-container'>
    <div class='help-content'>
      <div class='main'>
        <p>This chart shows the <b>Logical Processor's CPU utilization (%Busy)</b> of all hosts on the managed system, in a "non-stacked line" view.  This is calculated by the (sum of User%+System% individual CPU records) / (# of CPU records).  If Hyper-Threading (HT) is on, the number of CPU records could be two or more per physical core/virtual CPU.  Hyper-threading, also known as Simultaneous Multi-Threading (SMT), is the ability of a single physical processor to concurrently dispatch instructions from more than one hardware thread.  Two or more hardware threads can run on one physical processor at the same time.  Hyper-threading is a good choice when overall throughput is more important than the throughput of an individual thread.  For example, Web servers and database servers are good candidates.</p>
        <p>This is a quick view of all hosts on the server to determine their CPU utilization from 0-100% according to various characteristics defined (e.g. dedicated, shared, capped, # of virtual CPUs, hyper-threading, etc.).  Traditionally if the utilization percentage is consistently 80-100%, more CPU may be required for the host, requiring more virtual or dedicated processors to be added, entitlement to be increased or a process could be processing abnormally (looping) using CPU resources and needs to be investigated.</p>
      </div>
      <div class='definitions'></div>
      <div class='notes'>
        <p>Caution should be exercised when using this chart and one should have a thorough understanding of virtualization and hyper-threading.  For example, a host could have 4 virtual processors (cores) assigned to it and 4 logical processors (hyper-threads) per virtual processor.  This will present itself as 16 CPUs (4*4), giving the perception the host has the CPU capacity of 16 physical processors, when in fact it only has four cores.</p>

    Run Queue

      <div class='main'>
        <p>
          This chart displays the <b>Run Queue</b> of all hosts on the server in a "non-stacked
          line" view.  This is a quick view of all LPARs on the server.  The Run Queue indicates
          the number of active running processes on the host that are presently consuming
          resources.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, if the process "httpd" is running, but not being accessed, it will
          not be 'counted' in the run queue. In this case, the httpd process is sleeping,
          waiting for the next interrupt for it to begin processing. When an interrupt occurs,
          the httpd process will be moved to the run queue, and the run queue number will
          be increased by 1.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are several opinions and rule-of-thumbs on the run queue number, but it depends
          on your particular workload and service level objectives. If 'response time' is
          most important, you may want it no higher than 1 to 2 times the number of CPUs
          (virtual or real) allocated to the Host. If 'job throughput' is important, greater
          than 3 to 4 times times the number of CPUs may be sufficient to keep the processors busy
          especially with SMT On. A high run queue may be a sign of an overcommitted system, CPU intensive
          processes hogging the queue or a user/job-scheduling package or script mistakenly
          running too many processes at once. <b>Context Switch/System Calls</b>, <b>Processes
          Forks/EXECs</b> and the <b>CPU Utilization</b> charts may be of help.

      <div class='main'>
        <p>This chart shows the percentage of entitled capacity consumed.  This is only applicable to shared LPARs.  The entitled capacity percentage (%) can exceed 100% for shared uncapped LPARs.  This is a breakdown of the CPU consumed relative to the entitlement by the host.  It is very important to understand this is the % breakdown of the CPU Consumed towards 100% of the Entitlement.  This will show what % of CPU consumption is spent in User, System, IO Wait or Idle processing.  Typically User+Sys+IOwait+Idle = 100%.  But with VPs, SMT4 and Power7, some idle cycles are consumed and reported as Idle within the CPU consumed cycles.</p>
        <p>It should also be noted for dedicated capped LPARs, the entitlement is equal to the VPs and this chart will not reflect more than 100%, and should parallel the VP Utilization chart.</p>

      <div class='definitions'>
        <ul>
          <li><b>User</b> represents the percentage of time the host spent in user mode relative to entitlement.  Programs running in USER mode don't have access to the kernel or its data segments, except indirectly through system calls.  A program in this mode can only affect its own execution environment and runs in the processor-unprivileged state.</li>
          <li><b>System</b> represents the percentage of time the host spent in system mode relative to entitlement.  Programs that run in system mode include interrupt handlers, base kernel and kernel extensions (including device drivers).  Programs running in system mode have read/write access to global kernel address space and to the kernel data in the process private segment when running in the process context.  Context switch time, system calls, device interrupts, NFS I/O and anything else being processed by the kernel is considered system time.</li>
          <li><b>Wait</b> represents the percentage of time the host spent idle with pending disk I/O, relative to entitlement, to not only local, but also NFS-mounted disks.</li>
          <li><b>Idle</b> represents the percentage of time the host spent consuming Idle cycles (Used) relative to entitlement.</li>

    MAX CPUs by Pool

      <div class='main'>
        This chart shows the maximum CPU capacity that is available to the group of LPARs in each Shared Processor Pool.
      </div>
      <div class='definitions'></div>
      <div class='notes'>
        <p>Note: <b>Shared Processor Pools</b> can significantly reduce software licensing costs by limiting a GROUP of LPARs using the same software to a Maximum Capacity within a Pool.  The MAX capacity of the shared pool enforces the license cap, eliminating the need to procure a license for all processor cores in the managed system.</p>
        <p><b>Example Scenario</b>: You have an 8-core server with four LPARs, two of which are running ERP software licensed for the 8 cores.  The server is upgraded from 8 cores to 16 cores, but the two ERP LPARs only need 8.</p>
        <p><b>Solution</b>: Create Pool 1 with MAX=8, assign the two ERP LPARs to Pool 1, sharing the 8-core license.  The 2 non-ERP LPARs will default to Pool 0, using all 16-cores.  This saves money by assigning the 8-core ERP license to Pool 1, thus avoiding an increase in ERP licenses when unnecessary.</p>

    <div class='help-content'>
      <div class='main'>
        <p>This chart shows the total number of <b>Host Disk Write Transfers</b> (IO/s) that have occurred on all the hosts on the server in a "stacked area" view.  These values consist of write transfer operations on all adapters.  This server view can be used to determine which hosts have the highest write IO/s rate and if dedicated HBAs or sharing of HBAs between hosts should be considered (VIO/NPIV).</p>

        <p>For this chart to represent the entire SERVER, you must have the Galileo agent installed and fully operational on ALL LPARs.</p>

    Host Real Memory Free
  </h2>
  <div class='help-content-container'>
    <div class='help-content'>
      <div class='main'>
        <p>This chart shows the amount of FREE memory by all hosts in a "stacked area" view.  Hosts with the most amount of FREE memory can quickly be observed over the specified time range.  This FREE memory is as reported by each operating system.  Some operating systems will use additional memory to cache file(s) data, which is not reported as free memory, but often is "considered" memory which can be reduced or reallocated.</p>
        <p>For this chart to represent the entire SERVER, you must have the Galileo agent installed and fully operational on ALL LPARs.</p>
      </div>
      <div class='definitions'></div>
      <div class='notes'>
        Benefits and Tips:
        <ul>
          <li>The "Default" stacked area view shows the total amount of FREE memory of all the hosts, to assist in deciding if more memory is required on the server or if memory can be reallocated between hosts.</li>
          <li>Changing "Default" to "Line" shows an Unstacked Line for each Host, to quickly identify the host(s) with the most amount of FREE memory you may choose to reallocate.</li>
          <li>Before deciding  to reallocate or add more for a host or a Server, we recommend viewing this over a time range of 1-3 months or your critical day(s)/time(s).</li>
          <li>The "Host Computational Memory Used" chart should be viewed which shows the amount of Used memory minus cached file data. Hosts with large amounts of cached file data may be additional candidates to reallocate the memory elsewhere.</li>

        <p>This chart shows the utilization of virtual memory / paging space for all hosts on the server in a "non-stacked line" view. Each line represents the percent of that host's page space utilization relative to 100%. If a host shows a gradual increase towards 100%, this might be indicative of a memory related issue. A host ideally should be using very little of its virtual memory / paging space so read the notes below if more than 5-10% of page space is being used.</p>

      <div class='notes'>
        <p>Notes:</p>
        If the Paging Space becomes fully used, the OS will not allow new processes to be started and will begin to terminate existing processes in an attempt to survive.  A gradual increase of Paging Space usage over time should be investigated immediately to avoid a system outage.

        <p>In some cases, you may be unable to add new files to a filesystem even though it appears as though you have free space (MB).  This could be because all inodes on the given filesystem are used, which is most likely to happen on a filesystem with a very large number of (typically small) files.  The total number of inodes available to a filesystem is sometimes a static value, which means that the only way to increase it is to actually destroy and recreate a new filesystem.  However, this value can sometimes be dynamically increased as needed.  Whether or not this is a static or dynamic value is a function of the specific type of filesystem in use.  As such, refer to filesystem type documentation to determine if you can dynmically increase inodes.</p>

        Most commonly, within some scheduling scheme, one process needs to be switched out of the CPU so another process can run. This context switch can be triggered by the process making itself unrunnable, such as by waiting for an I/O or synchronization operation to complete.This Graph shows the number  of CPU Context Switches per second.Context switches are usually computationally intensive, and much of the design of operating systems is to optimize the use of context switches. Switching from one process to another requires a certain amount of time for doing the administration - saving and loading registers and memory maps, updating various tables and lists etc.

      <div class='main'>
        In systems programming, an interrupt is a signal to the processor emitted by hardware or software indicating an event that needs immediate attention. An interrupt alerts the processor to a high-priority condition requiring the interruption of the current code the processor is executing, the current thread. The processor responds by suspending its current activities, saving its state, and executing a small program called an interrupt handler (or interrupt service routine, ISR) to deal with the event. This interruption is temporary, and after the interrupt handler finishes, the processor resumes execution of the previous thread. This Graph shows the sum  of CPU Hardware and Software Interrupts per second.

      <div class='main'>
        This chart displays sum of GPFS READ and WRITE throughput in KB/Sec of a node. The values are collected using GPFS 'mmpmon' command with 'io_s' option. This chart is the indication of the GPFS I/O service-rate of a node, from the application point of view at the GPFS filesystem layer.  Values are displayed for only those nodes that have Galileo GPFS Agent Installed. The throughout values are the sum of throughputs of the GPFS file systems that are mounted on the node. If no  GPFS file systems are mounted on a node, then the throughput of that node is null.  The 'mmpmon' values are collected and aggregated based on the time period chosen as selected in Galileo Agent GUI.                                                                                                                                           Since these are discrete samples, there can be variations in the individual results and there may be other activity on the node or interconnection fabric. I/O size, file system block size, and buffering also affect these results and there can be many reasons why adjacent values differ. This must be taken into account when  interpreting results. The occasional zero rates in the chart  could be caused by reasons such as no I/O requests reaching GPFS during that time period ( the application issued none, or requests were satisfied by buffered data at a layer above GPFS), the node becoming busy with other work (causing the application to be undispatched), or other reasons.  This chart can be used to determine: GPFS data usage patterns at a particular time of the day, if a node is serving significantly more I/O than other nodes in the cluster and the total I/O demand the applications are placing on the GPFS cluster.

    <div class='help-content'>
      <div class='main'>
        This chart displays sum of GPFS READ and WRITE throughput of each Filesystem mounted on a node. The values are collected using the 'mmpmon' command with 'fs_io_s' option. This chart is the indication of the GPFS I/O service-rate of a Filesystem on a node, from the application point of view at the GPFS filesystem layer.   Values are displayed for only those nodes that have Galileo GPFS Agent Installed. The throughput values are for each GPFS Filesystem mounted on a node.  If no  GPFS fileystems are mounted on a node, then the GPFS Filesystem throughput of the throughput of that node is considered as null.  The 'mmpmon' values are collected for every 10 secs and aggregated based on the time period chosen.                                                                                                                                           Since these are discrete samples, there can be variations in the individual results. For example, there may be other activity on the node or interconnection fabric. I/O size, file system block size, and buffering also affect results. There can be many reasons why adjacent values differ. This must be taken into account when building analysis tools that read mmpmon output and interpreting results.                                The zero rates in the chart  could be caused by reasons such as no I/O requests reaching GPFS during that time period (the application issued none, or requests were satisfied by buffered data at a layer above GPFS), the node becoming busy with other work (causing the application to be undispatched), or other reasons.                          This chart can be used to determine: -GPFS data usage patterns at a particular time of the day, -if a node is serving significantly more I/O than other nodes in the cluster for a specific Filesystem, -the total I/O demand the applications are placing on the GPFS cluster.

        This chart shows defragmentation of each GPFS filesystem. In a ideal condition the defragmentation is not expected to exceed 10%. You can run 'mmdefrag' command if you see significant defragmentation for a specific filesystem. You can run the GPFS defrag command while the file systems are mounted. However, for better results, unmount the GPFS file system before performing the defragmentation operation. If there is no space in fragments or if the mmdefragfs command does not free up space, add additional disks (NSDs) to the file system to create space.

        GPFS utilizes a file system object called a fileset. A fileset is a subtree of a file system namespace that in many respects behaves like an independent file system. Filesets provide a means of partitioning the file system to allow administrative operations at a finer granularity than the entire filesystem. GPFS supports independent and dependent filesets. An independent fileset is a fileset with its own inode space. This chart shows all filesets that are created in each GPFS filesystem with the allocated GPFS quota and currently used quota sizes. This chart helps to identify the trends in quota usage over a period of time so that quotas for each fileset can be managed effectively. You can use 'mmedquota' command either to reduce or increase the allocated quota of a fileset.

    Volume Dirty Write Cache Hits Percentage

      <div class='main'>
        This chart shows the percentage of fast-write operations to a volume which resulted in a dirty write cache hit. A dirty write cache hit is a write where, for a given cache track, all sectors being written to that track already contain dirty data. Dirty data is data in the write cache that has not yet been destaged to back-end disk. Dirty write cache hits decrease the number of back-end writes required; for example, if a track is written to cache, then written to cache again prior to the data being destaged to disk, this results in two writes to cache but only one write to back-end disk. A write that spans multiple cache tracks can have both dirty write hits and misses.

        This chart shows the distribution (in percent) of write operations for the volume, displayed by fast-write mode (Fast), write-through mode (Through), flush-through mode (Flush) and cache-full mode (Overflow). In general, most traffic should be fast-write traffic, with some flush-through traffic for volumes that need to flush periodically (FlashCopy source volumes, for example). Write-through and cache-full traffic might warrant investigation.

        This chart shows Global Mirror Secondary Latency for each volume. For Global Mirror primary volumes, this shows the latency between the completion of the I/O at the primary site and the completion of the I/O (into mirrored cache) at the secondary site. This is the approximate Recovery Point Objective (RPO) the volume is achieving. For Global Mirror secondary volumes, this shows the latency waiting for writes upon which this write depends.

      <div class='main'>
        This chart shows the percentage of time a port has zero buffer-to-buffer (BB) credits available. When a port has zero BB credits available, it cannot transmit frames until a BB credit is released. High zero BB credit time can indicate a bottleneck is present in the SAN fabric. Potential causes of BB credit exhaustion include ports performing near their theoretical throughput limit, congested ISLs, and slow-drain host or storage devices. Zero BB credits on an SVC or Storwize port does not necessarily indicate that the SVC or Storwize port is the cause of the problem. Zero BB credit issues can often be traced to devices elsewhere in the SAN fabric.
