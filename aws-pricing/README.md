# Get AWS Pricing with the Ruby SDK

To use this tool:

* Ensure you have local creds available for aws
* Clone this repo
* Run `bundle install`
* Run `bundle exec ruby aws-pricing.json`

This creates an output file called: `xxxxxxxxx-aws-pricing.json` where xxxxxxxxx is the epoch timestamp.

See this link for the SDK dock: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-ruby/v3/api/index.html
